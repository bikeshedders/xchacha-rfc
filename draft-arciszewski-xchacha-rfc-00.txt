       XChaCha: eXtended-nonce ChaCha and AEAD_XChaCha20_Poly1305
                      draft-arciszewski-xchacha-00

Abstract

   The eXtended-nonce ChaCha cipher construction (XChaCha) allows for
   ChaCha-based ciphersuites to accept a 192-bit nonce with similar
   guarantees to the original construction, except with a much lower
   probability of nonce misuse occurring.  This enables XChaCha
   constructions to be stateless, while retaining the same security
   assumptions as ChaCha.

   This document defines XChaCha20, which uses HChaCha20 to convert the
   key and part of the nonce into a subkey, which is in turn used with
   the remainder of the nonce with ChaCha20 to generate a pseudorandom
   keystream (e.g. for message encryption).

   This document also defines AEAD_XChaCha20_Poly1305, a variant of
   [RFC7539] that utilizes the XChaCha20 construction in place of
   ChaCha20.

1.  Introduction

   AEAD constructions (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)
   allow for message confidentiality to be assured even in the presence
   of adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks, but they're known to be
   brittle to nonce-misuse conditions [1].

   Several nonce misuse resistant cipher constructions have been
   proposed over the years, including AES-SIV ([RFC5297]), AES-GCM-SIV
   [2], and several CAESAR candidates [3].

   However, a more straightforward strategy can prevent nonce misuse
   conditions in environments where a large number of messages are
   encrypted.  Simply use a large enough nonce such that applications
   can generate them randomly for each message and the probability of a
   collision remains low.

Internet-Draft                                            September 2018


   To this end, we propose a solution that is already implemented in
   many software projects that extends the nonce of ChaCha20 to 192 bits
   and uses it to build an AEAD construction.

1.1.  Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  AEAD_XChaCha20_Poly1305

   XChaCha20-Poly1305 is a variant of the ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD
   construction as defined in [RFC7539] that uses a 192-bit nonce
   instead of a 96-bit nonce.

   The algorithm for XChaCha20-Poly1305 is as follows:

   1.  Calculate a subkey from the first 16 bytes of the nonce and the
       key, using HChaCha20 (Section 2.2).

   2.  Use the subkey and remaining 8 bytes of the nonce (prefixed with
       4 NUL bytes) with AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 from [RFC7539] as
       normal.  The definition for XChaCha20 is given in Section 2.3.

   XChaCha20-Poly1305 implementations already exist in WireGuard [4],
   libsodium [5], Monocypher [6], xsecretbox [7], and in Go's crypto/
   chacha20poly1305 [8] library.

   Similarly, Google's HPolyC [9] implements XChaCha12-Poly1305.

2.1.  Motivation for XChaCha20-Poly1305

   The nonce used by the original ChaCha20-Poly1305 is too short to
   safely use with random strings for long-lived keys.
   XChaCha20-Poly1305 does not have this restriction.

   By generating a subkey from a 128-bit nonce and the key, a reuse of
   only the latter 64 bits of the nonce isn't security-affecting, since
   the key (and thus, keystream) will be different.  Additionally a re-
   use of only the first 128 bits of the nonce isn't security-affecting,
   as the nonce derived from the latter 64 bits is different.

   Assuming a secure random number generator, random 192-bit nonces
   should experience a single collision (with probability 50%) after
   roughly 2^96 messages (approximately 7.2998163e+28).  A more
   conservative threshold (2^-32 chance of collision) still allows for
   2^64 messages to be sent under a single key.

   Therefore, with XChaCha20-Poly1305, users can safely generate a
   random 192-bit nonce for each message and not worry about nonce-reuse
   vulnerabilities.

   As long as ChaCha20-Poly1305 is a secure AEAD cipher and ChaCha is a
   secure pseudorandom function (PRF), XChaCha20-Poly1305 is secure.

2.2.  HChaCha20

   *HChaCha20* is an intermediary step towards XChaCha20 based on the
   construction and security proof used to create XSalsa20 [10], an
   extended-nonce Salsa20 variant used in NaCl [11].

   HChaCha20 is initialized the same way as the ChaCha cipher, except
   that HChaCha20 uses a 128-bit nonce and has no counter.

   Consider the two figures below, where each non-whitespace character
   represents one nibble of information about the ChaCha states (all
   numbers little-endian):

                  cccccccc  cccccccc  cccccccc  cccccccc
                  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk
                  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk
                  bbbbbbbb  nnnnnnnn  nnnnnnnn  nnnnnnnn

           ChaCha20 State: c=constant k=key b=blockcount n=nonce

                  cccccccc  cccccccc  cccccccc  cccccccc
                  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk
                  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk  kkkkkkkk
                  nnnnnnnn  nnnnnnnn  nnnnnnnn  nnnnnnnn

                 HChaCha20 State: c=constant k=key n=nonce

   After initialization, proceed through the ChaCha rounds as usual.

   Once the 20 ChaCha rounds have been completed, the first 128 bits and
   last 128 bits of the ChaCha state (both little-endian) are
   concatenated, and this 256-bit subkey is returned.

2.2.1.  Test Vector for the HChaCha20 Block Function

   o  Key = 00:01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f:10:11:12:13:
      14:15:16:17:18:19:1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f.  The key is a sequence of
      octets with no particular structure before we copy it into the
      HChaCha state.

   o  Nonce = (00:00:00:09:00:00:00:4a:00:00:00:00:31:41:59:27)

   After setting up the HChaCha state, it looks like this:

                    61707865 3320646e 79622d32 6b206574
                    03020100 07060504 0b0a0908 0f0e0d0c
                    13121110 17161514 1b1a1918 1f1e1d1c
                    09000000 4a000000 00000000 27594131

                     ChaCha state with the key setup.

   After running 20 rounds (10 column rounds interleaved with 10
   "diagonal rounds"), the HChaCha state looks like this:

                    82413b42 27b27bfe d30e4250 8a877d73
                    4864a70a f3cd5479 37cd6a84 ad583c7b
                    8355e377 127ce783 2d6a07e0 e5d06cbc
                    a0f9e4d5 8a74a853 c12ec413 26d3ecdc

                       HChaCha state after 20 rounds

   HChaCha20 will then return only the first and last rows, resulting in
   the following 256-bit key:

                    82413b4 227b27bfe d30e4250 8a877d73
                    a0f9e4d 58a74a853 c12ec413 26d3ecdc

                        Resultant HChaCha20 subkey

2.3.  XChaCha20

   XChaCha20 can be constructed from an existing ChaCha20 implementation
   and HChaCha20.  All one needs to do is:

   1.  Pass the key and the first 16 bytes of the 24-byte nonce to
       HChaCha20 to obtain the subkey.

   2.  Use the subkey and remaining 8 byte nonce with ChaCha20 as normal
       (prefixed by 4 NUL bytes, since [RFC7539] specifies a 12-byte
       nonce).

   XChaCha20 is a stream cipher and offers no integrity guarantees
   without being combined with a MAC algorithm (e.g.  Poly1305).

   The same HChaCha20 subkey derivation can also be used in the context
   of an AEAD_ChaCha20_Poly1305 implementation to create
   AEAD_XChaCha20_Poly1305, as described in Section 2.
